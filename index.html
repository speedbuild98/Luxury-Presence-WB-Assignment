                  </h3>
                  <p>One of the biggest perks of working with a real estate agent is their
                        ability to market your
                        property to the right target audience. A professional agent with the right experience will be
                        able to identify who will be interested in your property and implement effective strategies to
                        reach them via their website, paid advertising, social media, and other means. When you work
                        with an agent who has partnered with <strong>Luxury Presence</strong>, you benefit from the many
                        different types
                        of marketing capabilities the company offers.

                        <p>To reach your potential buyers, you have to know who they are, where they spend their time
                              online, and how they make their buying decisions. Agents who use luxury real estate
                              marketing services are able to identify your niche market, then create paid ads on
                              Facebook, Google, Instagram, and YouTube that reach those interested in your property.
                              These paid ad campaigns are highly customized and targeted, ensuring you are not spending
                              money marketing to those who are not in the market for a property such as yours.</p>

                        <span>Expert Content Production</span>
                        <p>Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate agent has to promote your
                              property. Being able to create high-quality content such as video and copywriting is an
                              essential tool that elevates the agents who use luxury real estate marketing services
                              above their competitors. According to a recent survey, 85 percent of buyers and sellers
                              want to work with an agent who uses video—and for good reason. An agent who uses video is
                              able to connect with potential buyers on a deeper level and build trust and rapport. When
                              they use video to market your property, they are showing viewers what it would really be
                              like to walk through and live in your home—something that is much more difficult to do
                              with a written description.
                              However, written descriptions—or copywriting—is also important. Your property needs to be
                              described in appealing and vibrant terms on the listing and on any additional marketing
                              that is created to sell it. Those agents who work with Luxury Presence get access to
                              experienced real estate copywriters who create blogs, website copy, and content marketing
                              pieces that make your property attractive to potential buyers.
